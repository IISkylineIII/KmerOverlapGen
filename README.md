### Kmer Composition Generator

### Description:
The Kmer Composition Generator creates a unique representation of a given DNA sequence using k-mers of a specified length k, with an additional parameter d that defines an overlap region. The algorithm generates all unique k-mers in the sequence, formats them as (prefix|suffix) pairs, where the overlap of length d is considered, and outputs a sorted, formatted string of these pairs.

### Functionality:
1. kmer_composition(s, k, d):
* This function computes the k-mer composition of a given DNA sequence s, with a specified k-mer length and an overlap length d.
* It returns a sorted list of unique k-mers in the sequence.

2. format_kmer_composition(composition, k, d):

* This function formats the k-mer composition by generating pairs of adjacent k-mers, considering an overlap of length d between them.
* The result is returned as a formatted string of (prefix|suffix) pairs.


### Parameters:
s (str): Input DNA sequence (e.g., "TAATGCCATGGGATGTT").

k (int): Length of the k-mer to be considered.

d (int): Length of the overlap to be considered when formatting the k-mer pairs.

### Example Usage:
``` 
# Input sequence
sequence = "TAATGCCATGGGATGTT"

# Set parameters for k-mer length and overlap
k = 3  # Length of k-mer
d = 2  # Length of overlap

# Generate k-mer composition
composition = kmer_composition(sequence, k, d)

# Format and display the k-mer composition
result = format_kmer_composition(composition, k, d)
print(result)
```

### Output Example:
(TAA|AAT) (GCC|CCA) (ATG|TGG) (TGG|GGA) (GAT|ATG) (TGG|GGT)

### Applications
This script can be applied in various bioinformatics and computational biology contexts, including:
Genome Assembly: Useful in preprocessing steps for graph-based assembly, especially in constructing de Bruijn graphs from k-mers.
Sequence Analysis: Helps identify recurring sequence motifs or substrings within DNA, RNA, or protein sequences.
Comparative Genomics: Can be used to compare k-mer profiles across different organisms or strains.
Error Correction in Sequencing: K-mer analysis can assist in identifying sequencing errors based on unexpected or low-frequency k-mers.
Data Compression & Storage: Analyzing repeated patterns via k-mers can contribute to efficient biological data storage techniques.
